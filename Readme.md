**Motivation and Idea**

- Basically i was working with redux on project where i used localstorage and sessionstorage too much
- Accidently I  opened WhatsApp and opened the application section of developer options
- I found session storage local storage and surprised to see one more thing IndexdDB
- Now I started Exploring
- Many more things to explore
# Web Storage Mechanisms Comparison

|  | Indexed DB | Local Storage | Session Storage | Web SQL | Cookies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | IndexedDB is a NoSQL database that allows you to store structured data, such as objects or records, in a database. | Local Storage is a simple key-value store that allows you to store string data. | Session Storage is similar to Local Storage but is designed for temporary data storage during a browsing session. | Web SQL Database is a SQL-based database system that allows you to execute SQL queries to manipulate data. | Cookies are simple text-based data storage mechanisms. They store key-value pairs as strings. |
| **Storage Capacity** | It provides a larger storage capacity compared to Local Storage and Session Storage. It can store a substantial amount of data, often several megabytes or more. | It has a smaller storage capacity compared to IndexedDB and is typically limited to a few megabytes per domain. | Like Local Storage, it has a limited storage capacity, typically a few megabytes per domain. | Like IndexedDB, Web SQL Database can store a substantial amount of structured data, often several megabytes or more. | Cookies have a very limited storage capacity, usually restricted to a few kilobytes per cookie. |
| **Data Structure** | You can store complex data structures, including objects, arrays, and even files. | Data is limited to strings. You can store structured data as serialized JSON strings. | It stores data as strings, and structured data can be stored as serialized JSON strings. | You work with tables and SQL queries, making it suitable for structured data storage. | Data in cookies is limited to strings, so you can store simple values like user IDs, preferences, or session tokens. |
| **Querying** | IndexedDB supports querying and indexing data, which makes it suitable for applications that require searching and filtering of data. | Local Storage doesn't support querying or indexing, so you need to manage the data structure and retrieval yourself. | Session Storage, like Local Storage, doesn't support querying or indexing. | It supports querying and indexing data, allowing for complex data retrieval and manipulation. | Cookies are not designed for querying or indexing data. Accessing cookie data typically involves iterating through available cookies or knowing the specific cookie name. |
| **Scope** | IndexedDB is not tied to a specific window or tab. It is accessible across multiple tabs or windows, making it suitable for sharing data between different instances of a web application. | Data in Local Storage is limited to a single domain and is shared across all tabs and windows of that domain. | Data in Session Storage is also limited to a single domain but is session-specific. It is cleared when the session ends or the browser is closed. | It is typically limited to a single domain, and it can't be shared across different domains due to the same-origin policy. | Cookies are associated with a specific domain and are sent with every HTTP request to that domain, including requests for images, scripts, and styles. |
| **Synchronous** | IndexedDB operations are asynchronous, which means you need to handle callbacks or use Promises to work with data. | Local Storage operations are synchronous, making it easier to use for simple key-value storage. | Session Storage operations are synchronous, making it easier to use for simple key-value storage. | Web SQL Database supports both synchronous and asynchronous SQL operations, giving developers flexibility in how they interact with the database. | |Persistence: Cookies can have expiration dates, allowing you to create both session
                        cookies (temporary) and persistent cookies (long-lasting) |
